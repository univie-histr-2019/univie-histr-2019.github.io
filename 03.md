# Goals

Getting to know the basics of working with data: collecting, creating, organizing

# Software & Other Required Materials

- R
- OCR Engines (<https://www.onlineocr.net/>)
- Excel, Google Spreadsheets, or any other alternative 

# In Class I: *Theoretical and Conceptual*

## Ways of obtaining data

0. Main format
	* Tables; Spreadsheets; CSV / TSV files
	* **Note:** Relational DB is a collection of interconnected tables
1. Reusing already produced data
	* One may require to mold data into a more fitting structure
2. Creating one's own dataset
	* *Unique identifiers*:
		* tables with different data that can be connected via *unique identifiers*
		* *Open Linked Data*
		* **Example**:
			* Table of the growth of cities. One table includes information on population over time; Another table includes coordinates of the cities from the dataset. It is more efficient and practical (reducing error rate from typos) to work on these tables separately, and connect them via unique identifiers of cities which are used in both tables.
3. Digitizing data from printed and/or hand-written sources

## Basic principles of organizing data: *Tidy Data*

# In Class II: *Practical*

## Bulliet Dataset

|![Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data](./img/03/Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data.png)|
|:-:|
|The data set shows chrono-geographical distribution of Islamic scholars, according to one of the medieval biographical sources. Source: Bulliet, Richard W. 2009. *Cotton, Climate, and Camels in Early Islamic Iran: A Moment in World History*. New York: Columbia University Press.|

* Digitize a small data set from this [Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data.zip](../files/03/Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data.zip).
* Fix the dataset so that it confirms to the principles of **tidy data**. What should be corrected?
* Load the data set into R
* Data for regions is given in relative values. Calculate absolute values. Graph chronological distribution of Islamic scholars from each region both in absolute and relative values.

## Morris Dataset: *the East Vs. the West*

|![Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data_Morris.png](../img/03/Sample_Page_With_Tabular_Data_Morris.png)|
|:--|
|*War-making capacity since 4000 BCE (in social development points).* **Data source**: Morris, Ian. 2013. *The Measure of Civilization: How Social Development Decides the Fate of Nations*. Princeton: Princeton University Press.|

### Difficulty: Easy

* Digitize "War-making capacity since 4000 BCE" from this file [Morris_2013_Combined.pdf](../files/03/Morris_2013_Combined.pdf).
* Fix the dataset so that it confirms to the principles of **tidy data**. What should be corrected?
* Load the data set into R
* Graph chronological changes in war-making capacities for the East and the West.
* When the East was in the lead?
* When the West was in the lead?
* How can you determine that? (*Hint*: review logical operators and vector comparison).

### Difficulty: More complicated

* Digitize "Maximum Settlement Sizes" from this file [Morris_2013_Combined.pdf](../files/03/Morris_2013_Combined.pdf).
* Fix the dataset so that it confirms to the principles of **tidy data**. What should be corrected?
* The datasets for the East and the West are separate. What would be your strategies to combine them?
* Graph chronological changes in war-making capacities for the East and the West.
* When the East was in the lead? What were the most prominent settlements?
* When the West was in the lead? What were the most prominent settlements?
* How can you determine that? (*Hint*: review logical operators and vector comparison).

# Homework

## Practical

* Finish the assignment started in class; email report (ideally, as a PDF, since now it will include graphs).
* Find your own small data set published in a book or an article; digitize it using strategies discussed in class; run some analytical tasks (anything from what you have learned so far); create a report.
* Email both reports.

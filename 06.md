# Goals

To introduce basic principles for creating good visualizations; dos and don'ts; more practice with already familiar `ggplot` library for R.

# Homework

1. Read *Chapter 1. Look at data* from Healy's *Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.* (Link above); use what you will have learned from this chapter to complete your workbook.
2. Finish the workbook; if you can spot something that can be improved in the graphs that you generate in this workbook—explain (you are also encouraged to improved the graph accordingly—some googling may require :).
3. Finish Lessons 8-10 from `swirl`'s "Exploratory Data Analysis". Email screenshots with confirmation of completion of every chapter (these courses will not be offering to send emails!)

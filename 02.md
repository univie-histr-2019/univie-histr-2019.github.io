## Goals:

* Get to know the basics of R

## Software:

* *the same*, with some new libraries:
	* R <https://www.r-project.org/> 
	* R Studio <https://www.rstudio.com/>

## Class, Part I

* Review of the basics

## Class, Part II

* Practice Worksheets:
	* [01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.gz](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/00/01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.gz)
	* [02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.gz](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/00/02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.gz)

**NB:** Worksheet have beed developed and prepared by Lincoln Mullen. Source: Lincoln A. Mullen, *Computational Historical Thinking: With Applications in R (2018–)*: <http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com>.


## Homework:

* Complete worksheets that we started in class. Generate Notebooks with your work done. Email them to the instructor. You can email them in HTML, but also try to generate PDFs.
	* [01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.gz](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/00/01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.gz)
	* [02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.gz](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/00/02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.gz)
	* Do not forget to add your name into the `author` field in the YAML header of the notebook!

* **Additional practice:** Most of this material will (should) be familiar to you—if so, go through that chapter as quickly as you'd like, but, please, do so. At this stage review of relevant material is very important to get you comfortable with R code.
	* Complete Section 12: "Looking at Data" in *swirl* course *R Programming E: The basics of programming in R*. Do not forget to email me the confirmation.
	* Read Chapter 2 ("A Short Introduction to R") in Arnold, Taylor, and Lauren Tilton. 2015. *Humanities Data in R.* New York, NY: Springer Science+Business Media. (The chapter available on Moodle, and also in the University library)

# Goals

* Social Network Analysis
* Basic components
* `igraph` library: building and modifying `igraph` objects
* plotting graphs


# Software & Other Required Materials

- SNA Basics Worksheet: [09_Woksheet_SNA01.Rmd.zip](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/09/09_Woksheet_SNA01.Rmd.zip)
- SNA Sample DATA: [sw_network_data.zip](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/09/sw_network_data.zip)

# SNA Concepts

* **Networks**
  * Patterns of relationships that connect individuals, institutions, or objects (or leave them unconnected)
  * *Examples*: family ties—vertical and horizontal; patronage—who pays whom for what services; shared membership in organizations; paterns of contracts among companies.

* **Main elements**
  * Node (vertex, point, item)—person, organization, country, document, etc.
  * Edge (tie, link, line)—relationship, friendship, common attendance, co-occurance, kinship, membership
    * Directed and Undirected links: marriage—undirected; patronage—directed.
  * Graphs (Sociograms) / Matrices (pl. of matrix)

* **Graph properties**
  * **Density**: number of edges / number of edges in a complete graph (example of complete and incomplete graph)
  * **Centrality measures**
    * *Degree*: Proportional to the number of other nodes to which a node is links – Number of links divided by (n-1). For example: it may measure exposure to what is flowing through the network (opportunity to influence directly; in-degree and out-degree).
    * *Closeness* – The sum of shortest paths to all other points in the graph. Divide by (n-1), then invert. For example: it may measure how quickly information can travel.
    * *Betweenness* – The extent to which a particular point lies ‘between’ other points in the graph; how many shortest paths (geodesics) is it on? A measure of brokerage or gatekeeping (How often a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes)
    * *Eigenvector* – A weighted measure of centrality that takes into account the centrality of other nodes to which a node is connected.  That is, being connect with other central nodes increases centrality.  E.g., secretary of powerful person.  Google’s page rank algorithm is based on a variation of this approach.
  * **Modularity**—interconnected clusters.

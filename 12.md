# Homework

1. Topic modeling the “Dispatch”: using the provided R-script, run topic modeling on the “Dispatch”.
2. Change the number of topics to 40 and compare new results with the results for 25 topics. Record your observations.
2. Publish your observations as a blogpost on your website; compare your results with those of Rob Nelson’s *Mining the Dispatch* (<http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/>).

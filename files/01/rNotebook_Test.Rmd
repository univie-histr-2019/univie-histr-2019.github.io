# Installation instructions

Installation instructions can be found here <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html>.

What you need to do is to run the following line in `Console` (RStudio, check lower left corner):

``` r
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

Any package can be instaled in this manner.


You may have to run, to install `tinytex`:

``` r
tinytex::install_tinytex(force=TRUE)
```


# Basics

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

**NB**: `{r}` tells the system that this code must be executed; `r` simply highlights the code, but does not execute it.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Goals:

* Install R and R Studio and start working with them
	* R <https://www.r-project.org/> 
	* R Studio <https://www.rstudio.com/>
* Get to know R Notebooks (R markdown)
* Start learning R with the `swirl` package
	* Beginner: *R Programming: The basics of programming in R*
	* Intermediate: *Getting and Cleaning Data* 

## Software:

* R <https://www.r-project.org/> 
* R Studio <https://www.rstudio.com/>

## Class, Part I

* R Studio Interface
* Installing libraries (packages)
* R Notebook elements: combining prose and code
* Converting R Notebook into different formats

### 

## Class, Part II

1. Install `swirl`:

``` r
install.packages("swirl")
```

2. Run a course by typing the following in your command line (might be better to use your command line, instead of R Studio). Type `r` to start R, then:

```

library(swirl)
install_course("R Programming E")
swirl()
```

3. Complete "R Programming E" course. There should be an option to send an email to the instructor, confirming that you have completed it.


## Reference materials:

* Your `R` installation may ‘speak’ your main language. It is nice on one hand, but can be quite inconvenient in class, where the main language is English. You may have to do cast some spells to switch `R` into English. Possible solutions can be found here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575180/how-to-change-language-settings-in-r/>


## Homework:

* Complete swirl's course *R Programming: The basics of programming in R*
* Write a report (R Notebook), summarizing what you have learned. Use one or two examples from each lesson.
* Email (or Moodle) your report in HTML and PDF formats.

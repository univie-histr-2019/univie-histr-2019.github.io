# Aims, contents and method of the course

The course will offer a practical introduction into R programming language, which is currently one of the most popular choices of humanists interested in investigating humanities problems with computational methods. Following the general introduction, the course will cover a series of cases of how one can analyze textual, historical and spatial data with statistics-based and visual methods.

# Course Evaluation 

Assessment will be based on class participation, homework assignments, and a final project.

# Class Participation

Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. BRING YOUR LAPTOP! We will accommodate whatever operating system you use, but it should be a laptop rather than a tablet. Don’t forget that asking for help counts as participation!

# Homework

* For each class you will be creating reports, which can be then submitted as PDFs (email or Moodle), or published as your own Shiny web application.
* DH is a collaborative field, so you are most welcome to work on your homework assignments in groups, however, you must still submit them individually. That is, if a groups of three works on one assignment, there must be three separate submissions by each member of the group. 

# Final Project

* The final project is a portfolio of detailed reports for each class. You are highly encouraged to use your own dataset for the final project and your weekly assignments.

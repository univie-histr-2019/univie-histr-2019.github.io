# Goals

Getting to know the basics of working with data: manipulating data, basic techniques of exploratory analysis (aka, "know your data")

# Software & Other Required Materials

- R
- Worksheets (start in class, finish at home)
	- [03_worksheets_data-manipulation-introduction.Rmd.zip](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/00/03_worksheets_data-manipulation-introduction.Rmd.zip)
	- [04_worksheets_data-manipulation-continued.Rmd.zip](https://univie-histr-2019.github.io/files/00/04_worksheets_data-manipulation-continued.Rmd.zip)
- `swirl()` courses (at home):
	- `"Getting and Cleaning Data"` (all 4 chapters)
	- `"Exploratory Data Analysis"` (first 7 chapters are required, but you are encouraged to do all 15 chapters)

## On `swirl()`

*To install*, `swirl()` courses:

```{r}
library(swirl)
install_course("Getting and Cleaning Data")
install_course("Exploratory Data Analysis")
```

To run:

```{r}
library(swirl)
swirl()
```

You will be offered to choose a course. Email screenshots with confirmation of completion of every chapter (these courses will not be offering to send emails!)


# Homework

* Finish both worksheets and email your notebooks (HTML or PDF, preferably the latter).
* Find a dataset for your final project (your final project will be to analyze the dataset of your choice with all the methods that we cover in the course).
